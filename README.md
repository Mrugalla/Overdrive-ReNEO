# Overdrive-ReNEO
an mda overdrive tribute project

Hello, welcome to my Overdrive ReNEO project page. As the name suggests this is a tribute on mda overdrive. But it's not a remake.
The developer hollance has this project, in which he attempts to convert all of the iconic mda plugins to modern JUCE-projects:
https://github.com/hollance/mda-plugins-juce

I used his mda overdrive code as the foundation, but changed it a lot to not only bring mda into the present with a modern code style,
but also by (hopefully) improving what it does to the sound. For example I replaced the 6db/oct filter with a 12db/oct one, I massively
turned up the input gain and added 2 new parameters that do more than just dry/wet-mixing the overdrive sound. Also added a pan-knob
that can be used to pan the distortion parameter to L/R or M/S. You can also turn up 2x oversampling if you want to, but that feature is
quite cpu-intensive, because I still suck at making efficient convolution. Hope you all have a lot of fun with this :)

The sound of this plugin is really unique. I'm not a guitar player myself but I was told it's not what you'd usually
expect from an overdrive pedal. I personally love it for all my memories with it. A long time ago I used mda overdrive
a lot on various synth patches and autotuned vocals and when I started working on this project I immediatly noticed that this
vibe was missing in my own productions for a long time, so I'm very happy I'm able to bring it back with this plugin.
