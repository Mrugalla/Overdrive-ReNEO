# Overdrive-ReNEO
an mda overdrive tribute project

Hello, welcome to my Overdrive ReNEO project page. As the name suggests this is a tribute on mda overdrive. But it's not a remake.
The developer hollance maintains this project, in which he attempts to convert all of the iconic mda plugins to modern JUCE-projects:
https://github.com/hollance/mda-plugins-juce

I used his mda overdrive code as the foundation, but changed it a lot to not only bring mda into the present with a modern code style,
but also by building new features on top of it. For example I replaced the 6db/oct filter with a 12db/oct one, I massively
turned up the input gain and added 2 new parameters that do more than just dry/wet-mixing the overdrive sound. Also added a pan-knob
that can be used to pan the distortion parameter (L/R or M/S). You can also activate hq mode for 2x oversampling.
And there is a pre-overdrive gate to make silence between the notes.

The sound of this plugin is really unique. I'm not a guitar player myself but I was told it's not what you'd usually
expect from an overdrive pedal. I personally use it mostly on vocals and one of my friends loves to use it on drums.
I have a lot of cool memories with it. A long time ago I used mda overdrive a lot and when I started working on this
project I immediatly noticed that this vibe was missing in my own productions for a long time,
so I'm very happy I'm able to bring it back with this plugin.
